                    <div class="description">In order to get more customers into events, a ticket marketplace where
                        event holders could upload the unsold tickets was created. This means that the venue gets more
                        customers, promoting their location and increasing profits due to higher footfall, the artist
                        gets more exposure due to a larger audience and the consumer can go to events at a reduced cost.

                    <div class="section-title">Technical Description</div>
                    <div class="description">The app uses an Ionic/Angular frontend to allow the use of Angular for
                        native mobile development with a Go backend. The backend is split into stateless services, each
                        stored in seperate repos, running on seperate containers, allowing each one to be deployed
                        seperately. This allows for easier individual scaling if needed. The services communicate via
                        HTTPS and currently are split into Events and Tickets.

                        The Events service handles all interactions with retrieving and creating new events and the
                        Tickets services handles all interactions with retrieving and creating new tickets. Along with
                        data describing an event, the coordinates of the event is stored, therefore when a user opens
                        the app, it can retrieve their location and calculate the distance to each event and only
                        retrieve the events with a set maximum distance. This was achieved using PostGIS.

                        AI tools such as ChatGPT and Co-Pilot were also used in the development to generate test data to
                        insert into the databases as well as to debug code.

                        The video below shows a prototype of the app, where a user can log in, can search the events
                        within their area, "buy" a ticket which adds it to their user in the backend, then can use the
                        ticket to have it marked as used.
